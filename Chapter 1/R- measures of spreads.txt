Q. Calculate the quartiles of the co2_emission column of food_consumption.

# Calculate the quartiles of co2_emission
quantile(food_consumption$co2_emission)



Q. Calculate the six quantiles that split up the data into 5 pieces (quintiles) of 
the co2_emission column of food_consumption.

# Calculate the quartiles of co2_emission
quantile(food_consumption$co2_emission, probs = seq(0,1,0.2))



Q. Calculate the eleven quantiles of co2_emission 
that split up the data into ten pieces (deciles).

# Calculate the deciles of co2_emission
quantile(food_consumption$co2_emission, probs = seq(0,1,0.1))

Q. Calculate the variance and standard deviation of co2_emission 
for each food_category by grouping by and summarizing variance 
as var_co2 and standard deviation as sd_co2.
Create a histogram of co2_emission for each food_category using facet_wrap().


# Calculate variance and sd of co2_emission for each food_category
food_consumption %>% 
  group_by(food_category) %>% 
  summarize(var_co2 = var(co2_emission),
     sd_co2 = sd(co2_emission))

# Plot food_consumption with co2_emission on x-axis
ggplot(data=food_consumption, aes(co2_emission)) +
  # Create a histogram
  geom_histogram() +
  # Create a separate sub-graph for each food_category
  facet_wrap(~ food_category)

Q. Calculate the total co2_emission per country by grouping by country and taking 
the sum of co2_emission. Call the sum total_emission and store the resulting 
data frame as emissions_by_country.

# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country <- food_consumption %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_emission = sum(co2_emission))

emissions_by_country




Q. Compute the first and third quartiles of total_emission 
and store these as q1 and q3.

Calculate the interquartile range of total_emission and store it as iqr.

# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country <- food_consumption %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_emission = sum(co2_emission))

# Compute the first and third quartiles and IQR of total_emission
q1 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.75)
iqr <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.75) - quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.25)



Q. Calculate the lower and upper cutoffs for outliers of total_emission, 
and store these as lower and upper.


# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country <- food_consumption %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_emission = sum(co2_emission))

# Compute the first and third quartiles and IQR of total_emission
q1 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.75)
iqr <- q3 - q1

# Calculate the lower and upper cutoffs for outliers
lower <- q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper <- q3 + 1.5 * iqr





Q. Use filter() to get countries with a total_emission greater than the upper cutoff or 
a total_emission less than the lower cutoff.

# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country <- food_consumption %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_emission = sum(co2_emission))

# Compute the first and third quartiles and IQR of total_emission
q1 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.75)
iqr <- q3 - q1

# Calculate the lower and upper cutoffs for outliers
lower <- q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper <- q3 + 1.5 * iqr

# Filter emissions_by_country to find outliers
emissions_by_country %>%
  filter(total_emission < lower | total_emission > upper)
